# Test Plan

## Levels

- Unit tests (firmware and UI)
- Hardware‑in‑the‑loop tests
- End‑to‑end tests
- Fault and fail‑safe tests
- Measurements (noise, latency and linearity)

## Metrics

- HID latency under ten milliseconds
- Noise level within sensor specification
- Linearity error below target threshold
